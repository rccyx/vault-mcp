# Code of Conduct

This project exists to build correct, high-quality software with minimal friction. It values competence, autonomy, and efficient collaboration.

This Code of Conduct exists to keep interactions clean, focused, and workable.

So be cool and be clear. Get things done.

## Scope

This applies to all interactions related to this repository, including issues, pull requests, discussions, reviews, and any project-adjacent community spaces that the maintainer uses for coordination.

## Expected behavior

Communicate clearly and in good faith. Keep discussions technical, concrete, and actionable. Disagree without being disrespectful. Respect other people’s time. If you’re making a claim, bring evidence: links, code, repro steps, or specs.

Bluntness is fine. Disrespect is not.

## Unacceptable behavior

The following behaviors are not acceptable in this repository or any project-related discussion space:

Personal attacks, insults, harassment, or discriminatory behavior.  
Threats, doxxing, intimidation, or encouragement of harm.

Deliberate misrepresentation of facts, impersonation, or false claims of affiliation, authority, or expertise.  
Repeated bad-faith arguing, agenda posting, sealioning, or attempts to “win” discussions rather than resolve technical questions.

Reopening settled decisions under new issues, pull requests, or reframed questions after a clear maintainer decision has been made.  
Routing around maintainer decisions through escalation, tagging, back-channeling, or social pressure.

Derailing discussions, flooding threads with low-signal content, bikeshedding, or using issues or pull requests as a personal stage.  
Using this repository for SEO manipulation, backlink insertion, marketing, or self-promotion.

Support requests disguised as bugs or issues, vague problem reports that offload investigation work onto maintainers, or demands for debugging of personal environments.

Guilt framing or obligation creation, including appeals to “the community,” popularity, stars, external deadlines, business impact, or implied responsibility for downstream usage or breakage.

Pressuring maintainers into decisions, timelines, emotional engagement, or unpaid consulting.

Any behavior that materially increases maintenance burden without contributing corresponding value.

## Maintainer action

This is a maintainer-led project. Maintainers may take action to keep the project usable and sane, including requesting changes, closing issues or pull requests, locking threads, or blocking accounts.

When practical, maintainers will leave a short reason for moderation actions. This is best-effort, not a guarantee.

Severe behavior can result in immediate action.

## Reporting concerns

If something is materially harming collaboration or progress, raise it through GitHub in a factual and concise way. If you need to report sensitive behavior privately, contact the maintainer via the email listed in the repository metadata. Do not escalate socially or create public campaigns.

## No guarantees

There is no guarantee of response, mediation, or resolution. Silence does not imply agreement, endorsement, or approval.
